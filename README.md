# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features from the California housing dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the **California Housing dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes features such as:

- Median Income
- House Age
- Average Rooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude
- ...and more

- Model training using **XGBoost Regressor**
- Performance evaluation (R² Score, MSE)
- Final predictions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using:
- R² Score
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
